# Computer Graphics - Boid Simulation
<hr>
## Languages & Tools Used

**Languages Used:** C/C++  
**Libraries Used:** OpenGL, GLEW  
**Developed On:** Linux(Debian)  
[Github Page](https://github.com/charles-mowbray/Under-The-Sea)
## Overview
- Developed a 3D graphic simulation of fish under the sea leveraging the openGL library 
- Developed Dynamic lighting with Phong shaders, Geometric Shaders for natural movement, and texture shaders to map on to surfaces
- Using documentation from pixars write ups on shading and [Ben Eaters boids](https://github.com/beneater/boids/blob/master/boids.js) alogrithm

## Description
Developed a fully functional graphics engine from the ground up on linux using the boids algorithm to mimic flocking fish pattens. Loading the shaders on to the graphics card at runtime. Allowing the user to interact with and control where the school of fish are directed to.
